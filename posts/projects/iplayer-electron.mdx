I created an Electron wrapper for BBC iPlayer to solve an extremely niche problem with my Steam Link; for some reason it can't detect that Chrome or Firefox is open when I launch it through Steam, which means I'd have to exit Big Picture Mode, then navigate to BBC iPlayer using the controller as a mouse. Not ideal.

In the process I decided to make it look pretty for normal use too, and although the code itself isn't earth-shattering, after noticing not many people had made an Electron wrapper for iPlayer, I decided to open source it on GitHub.

This was a great opportunity to learn more about Electron and CSS injection, and I had fun making it look nice and clean, and as a bonus it works great with my Steam Link setup.
