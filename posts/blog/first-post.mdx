I've never been any good at writing in general, let alone blog posts, but I've heard it's the done thing, so here goes.

Hello! I'm Dan, I'm 23 years old as of writing, and I've just come out of university with a degree in Computer Science.
I love building things that solve my niche problems, and I'm a huge music nerd.
I play the trumpet, guitar and bass (in descending order of proficiency), and I'm mostly playing jazz stuff right now. 

In this blog, you can expect to see mostly opinion posts about technologies I try out, updates on projects I'm working on, and perhaps album reviews!


If you want to get in touch, feel free to contact me through the links below.

Thanks for reading!\
Dan
